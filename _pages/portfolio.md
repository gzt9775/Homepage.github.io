# Course Projects

*Here I have listed some of the course projects I completed either individually or in collaboration with a group during my undergraduate studies. Most of these projects achieved the highest scores in the entire statistics department. If you are interested in these projects, please feel free to communicate with me via email or WeChat.*

### Multi-layer Community Detection with Network Embedding and Dependent Connectivity 

**Course Name: Fundamentals of Statistical Algorithm (Achieved the Highest Score in the Statistics Department)**

 - Extended network embedding model for detecting inner and outer communities in directed multi-layer networks and incorporating correlation information between connections.
 - Designed an optimization iterative algorithm for the proposed model to maximize the joint likelihood function.
 - Conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the model's performance and applied it to real-world datasets for research.

### Time-series Forecasting Using ARIMA-GARCH and Neural Network

**Course Name: Time Series Analysis (Selected for Exhibition as an Outstanding Course Work)**

 - Researched contemporary popular time series ensemble models and learned signal processing algorithms like Empirical Mode Decomposition.
 - Expanded the VMD-GARCH/LSTM-LSTM model into a more diverse range of neural networks, exploring the performance of different neural networks.
 - Utilized MAE and RMSE metrics to compare our experimental results, finding that replacing the LSTM model with a classic RNN model significantly improved prediction accuracy on some datasets.

### Vehicle Data Analysis and Driver Behavior Prediction

**Course Name: Applied Statistical Software (Achieved the Highest Score in the Statistics Department)**

 - Rectified measurement errors within experimental data and executed fundamental data processing.
 - Carried out a detailed analysis of vehicle networking data using statistical methods, including: box plot analysis, fitting
error analysis, quantile regression analysis, time series analysis and cluster analysis.
 - Investigated the correlation between car speed change rates and wheel speed, and visualized the car gear’s time series
diagram based on the findings.
 - Analyzed driver’s behavior habits and inferred road conditions, including road openess and the presence of traffic lights.
