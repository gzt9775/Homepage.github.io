### Multi-layer Community Detection with Network Embedding and Dependent Connectivity 

<br>

- **Receieved the highest score in Fundamentals of Statistical Algorithm course**

We propose a novel method by building network embeddings and detecting in-communities and out-communities in directed multi-layer networks. Network embedding has been a popular tool to represent network in a low-dimensional vector space so that network structure can be largely preserved. Different from the existing network embeddings, the proposed method incorporates correlation information among connectivities to achieve more accurate community detection than independent likelihood method using marginal information only. The key idea is to approximate the joint distribution of correlated within-community connectivities by using a truncated Bahadur representation. The Bahadur representation is a mathematical tool used in statistics to approximate the likelihood function of a sum of dependent random variables. Although the approximate likelihood function is not the true likelihood, it is able to maximize the true community memberships and serves as tighter lower bound to the true likelihood compared with the independent likelihood. Consequently, we identify communities via maximizing the approximate likelihood function. Compared to the existing random-effects model, the proposed method is more flexible in modeling the communities for multiple networks and correlations among edges.
