Realizing the need for a solid and diverse educational foundation for deeper statistical studies, I self-studied advanced topics in Statistics and Machine Learning from my freshman year. In my sophomore spring, I attended seminars on emerging subjects and independently studied Optimization Theory, honing my intuition and expertise. I also believe a solid foundation in Computer Science, could enhance my programming skills and breadth of knowledge, integrating computational thinking into my future research. Therefore, I took an additional 20 credits of core courses at the School of Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, my research experience primarily focused on time series analysis, statistical network analysis, and data science. These scientific research experiences have produced some results, including but not limited to some academic papers and software.

During my undergraduate years, I also explored various research areas, hoping to delve into more fields in the future to address genuinely interesting and meaningful problems. I am particularly interested in the development and application of statistical and data science methodologies, as well as interdisciplinary research in statistics with fields like physics and biology. In-depth exploration of different disciplines can broaden one's perspective, equipping one with core technologies and offering more choices for the future. The prospect of using my methods to solve real-world problems has always been exhilarating.
