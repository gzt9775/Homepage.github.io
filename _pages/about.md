Welcome to my homepage! My name is ZhengtaoGui. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2024. I was fortunate to be enrolled in the [School of the Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/) at USTC, for which I skipped my third year of high school. I am a student who wants to learn all the unknowns and a researcher who is fond of the beauty of mathematics and of the beings. I love statistics, which is both my life and my fun, the real logic of this world lies in the calculus of probability.

Research Interests
======

I have broad interests in the span of network analysis, statistics, and optimization. I enjoy using mathematical and computational tools to develop theoretical foundations and principled methods for real-world problems.
